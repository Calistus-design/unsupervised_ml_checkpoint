# Unsupervised Machine Learning Checkpoint 

## Overview

This is a checkpoint assignment focused on applying **unsupervised machine learning techniques** to real-world data. It demonstrates proficiency in:

- Dimensionality reduction using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- Clustering analysis and evaluation using **K-Means** and **Silhouette Scores**
- Visualizing results of unsupervised models for interpretation and insights

The assignment was completed using the provided `sensor_data.csv` dataset within a Jupyter notebook environment.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn (PCA, KMeans, silhouette_score)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Reduced high-dimensional sensor data to a smaller number of principal components while retaining most variance.
- Visualized the first two components to explore structure in the data.

### 2. K-Means Clustering
- Applied K-Means to identify patterns/groups within the data.
- Chose an optimal number of clusters using silhouette scores.
- Visualized clusters in PCA-reduced space for clearer interpretation.

### 3. Evaluation of Clusters
- Calculated **silhouette scores** to assess the quality and separability of clusters.
- Used color-coded scatter plots to show cluster assignments.
